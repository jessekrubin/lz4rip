# Safety

## Unsafe boundary

The `lz4rip` facade exposes safe compression and decompression APIs. The default
build isolates unsafe code to 20 blocks in 4 modules across 3 crates. Most blocks
perform unchecked reads or writes whose bounds are proven by safe-region margins
computed in the algorithm code.

The internal hash-table trait and generic decompression entry point are not
exported, so downstream safe code cannot construct invalid match candidates for
unchecked encoder reads or supply a custom `Sink` whose capacity lies to the
decoder fast path. See [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) for the unsafe-site inventory,
frame-compression table invariants, and safe-region margin computation.

## Paranoid build (zero unsafe)

The `paranoid` feature compiles every crate with `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`, so the
build contains no `unsafe` at all. Each unchecked memory op is replaced by a safe
twin (bounds-checked indexing, `copy_within`/`copy_from_slice`, `from_ne_bytes`
reads, `chunks_exact` match counting) with the same signature, so callers are
unchanged. This is for users and policies that forbid `unsafe` outright (e.g.
`#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` in a downstream crate, or certification regimes). It
trades a small amount of throughput for the guarantee; the default build keeps the
isolated-unsafe design above. The two builds are byte-for-byte compatible: output
of one decompresses with the other.

## Why Rust matters here

C lz4's "safe" decompression API (`LZ4_decompress_safe` and variants) has had
memory safety bugs that Rust's type system and bounds checking prevent by
construction:

| CVE / Fix | Bug | Rust prevents because |
|-----------|-----|----------------------|
| [CVE-2021-3520](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3520) (CVSS 9.8) | Negative `outputSize` wraps to huge `size_t`, heap overflow in `LZ4_decompress_safe_partial` | `usize` is unsigned, slice lengths can't be negative |
| [CVE-2014-4715](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2014-4715) | Integer overflow in literal-run accumulator on 32-bit causes memory corruption | Slice indexing panics on OOB regardless of overflow |

| [PR #1753](https://github.com/lz4/lz4/pull/1753) (2026) | OOB read in `read_variable_length()`: byte read before bounds check | `.get()` checks before read |

| [PR #1737](https://github.com/lz4/lz4/pull/1737) | `read_variable_length` overflow undetected on 64-bit (guard was `sizeof(length) < 8`) | OOB access after overflow caught by bounds check |
| [PR #1737](https://github.com/lz4/lz4/pull/1737) | Match-length overflow check misordered: `MINMATCH` added after the wraparound test | Slice index from wrapped value caught by bounds check |
| [PR #1737](https://github.com/lz4/lz4/pull/1737) | `frameRemainingSize` unsigned underflow wraps to huge value in `LZ4F_decompress` | Debug panic on underflow; OOB caught by bounds check in release |
| [e72d4423](https://github.com/lz4/lz4/commit/e72d44230093) | Fast decode loop skips dictionary bounds check, reads up to 64 KB before output buffer | `copy_within` bounded by slice length |
